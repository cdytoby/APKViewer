# APKViewer

Work in Progress APK Viewer, using .Net Standard and .Net Framework.

### To all passerby

Please try not to create any issue tickets before the tool is proper released, unless the unactive time is more than 2 months, or the topic is rather urgent. 

Once it's released, feel free to create any issue for bug-report, feature-request, improvement-suggestion. 

### Reason I do this:

There is already a very good APK-Info out there, https://github.com/Enyby/APK-Info It's a good one, and it already contains much more features. So if you're looking for such tools, be sure to check that out.

The reason I do this because:
- I don't have any GitHub open source project experience, and this is my very first one.
- I don't trust AutoIt, I noticed that many exes export from it will be recognised as virus. That's probably faulty report, but I still don't trust this tool.
- I'm using .Net Standard for potencial multiplatform approach. I want it go multiplatform. And the reason I don't use other framework is just because I don't know how to do them. I can only do good programming c#.

### My Plan

Things I'm planning to do before 1.0:
- Drag and Drop apk file
- View basic information incl. package name, icon, version, sdk, etc.
- View Sign signiture.
- View APK hash.
- Open in Google Play Store.

Things I might do after 1.0:
- Multi-platform Support for MacOS and Linux. (I have zero experience on MacOS and Linux development)
- UI Multi-language
- xapk file support
- install using adb

Things I don't think I'll do
- Rename file
- open in other apk website like apkpure
- Hash Compare
- Decompile or unpack apk.
