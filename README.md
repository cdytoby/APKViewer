### To all passerby

Free to create issues for bug-report, feature-request, improvement-suggestion and so on. Especially if the project is many years old and has issue with newer OS or special apks.

I need help for making macOS version. If you think you can do this and want to support this project, go for it and feel free to make Pull requests. I have a macOS machine to test in my workplace, and we appretiate your support.

### About this project

There is already a very good APK-Info out there, and it contains more features.

The reason I do this because:
- I don't have any GitHub open source project experience, and this is my very first one.
- I don't trust AutoIt, I noticed that many exes export from it will be recognised as virus. That's probably faulty report, but I still don't trust this tool.
- I'm using .Net Standard for potencial multiplatform approach. I want it go multiplatform. And c# with .Net Standard is the only knowledge I have to create a multiplatform app with good UI.

### My Plan

Things I'm planning to do before 1.0:
- Drag and Drop apk file
- View basic information incl. package name, icon, version, sdk, etc.
- View Sign signiture.
- View APK hash.
- Open in Google Play Store.

Things I might do after 1.0:
- Multi-platform Support for MacOS and Linux. (I have zero experience on MacOS and Linux development)
- UI Multi-language
- xapk file support
- install using adb

Things I don't think I'll do
- Rename file
- open in other apk website like apkpure
- Hash Compare
- Decompile or unpack apk.
