# APKViewer

Work in Progress APK Viewer, using .Net Framework.

Things I'm planning to do before 1.0:
- Drag and Drop apk file
- View basic information incl. package name, version, sdk, etc.
- View Sign signiture.
- View APK hash.
- Open in Google Play Store.

Things I might do after 1.0:
- Multi-platform Support for MacOS and Linux. (I have zero experience on MacOS and Linux development)
- UI Multi-language
- xapk file support
- install using adb

Things I don't think I'll do
- Rename file
- open in other apk website like apkpure
- Hash Compare
- Decompile or unpack apk.
